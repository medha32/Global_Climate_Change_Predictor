# Global_Climate_Change_Predictor_using_streamlit

# Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes climate change impact factors using machine learning. It loads a dataset, computes an "Impact Score" based on various climate indicators, and trains an XGBoost model to predict this score.

# Features
Computes a weighted impact score using factors like CO2 emissions, sea level rise, temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed.

Trains an XGBoost regression model to predict the impact score.
